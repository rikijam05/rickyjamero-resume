    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate Gray and Cool Blue -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A multi-section, single-page application designed for non-linear exploration. The structure includes: 1) A header with a summary for immediate impact. 2) An interactive career timeline where users click a job to see details, making history explorable. 3) A filterable skills explorer to categorize and showcase technical breadth. 4) A dedicated "Featured Projects" section to highlight key achievements. This structure was chosen to transform the static resume into an engaging portfolio, allowing recruiters to quickly grasp key strengths and delve into areas of interest without linear scrolling, enhancing usability and information retention. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Career History -> Goal: Organize/Change -> Viz: Interactive vertical timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click job title to show/hide details in a dedicated pane. Justification: More engaging and organized than a long text list. 2) Technical Skills -> Goal: Organize/Compare -> Viz: Filterable buttons and dynamic text area (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click category to display specific skills. Justification: Breaks down a large data matrix into digestible, user-controlled chunks. 3) Key Achievements -> Goal: Inform/Engage -> Viz: Content Cards (HTML/CSS). Justification: Elevates high-impact projects from the main text body for better visibility. -->
